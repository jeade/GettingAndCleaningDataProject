This is the codebook that describes the variables in the tidyData data frame output from the "justDoIt()" function:

  subject activity           measure        avg

subject (int) 
-- Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
-- Data come from test/subject_test.txt and train/subject_train.txt
-- No filters or clean-up have been applied to this variable
-- Used in the group_by clause

activity (factor)
-- Name of the activity performed
-- Sourced from activity_labels.txt
-- Values:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

-- No filters or cleanup have been applied to this variable
-- Used in the group_by clause

measure (character)
-- Name of the measurement (for more details read the README.txt in the UCI HAR dataset)
-- Sourced from features.txt
-- Filtered on mean() and std()
-- Used in the group_by clause

avg (numeric)
-- Calculated from the measurements sourced from test\X_test.txt and train\X_train.txt datasets
-- Contains the average (mean) values of measurements grouped by subject/activity/measure
